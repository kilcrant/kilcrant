Work History

I served 4 years of Active Duty with the U.S. Marine Corps as a Transmissions System Operator and Publication Library Management Supervisor.
As my enlistment came to an end, I decided to pursue my Civilian Career. I currently work as a Manufacturing Technician at Raytheon Missiles and Defense, and transitioned into the Navy Reserves as a Cryptologic Technician Collections (CTR).
